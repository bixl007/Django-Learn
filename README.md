# Welcome to Django-Learn!

This repository is a collection of resources and projects I made during learning Django web framework. Django is a powerful Python-based web framework that makes it easier to build web applications.

## Getting Started
To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bixl007/Django-Learn.git
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```
   cd Django-learn
   uv venv
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
   This creates an isolated Python environment for my project.

3. **Install the requirements**:
   ```
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This installs the necessary Python packages for the Django projects.

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```
   cd djangoBE
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   This starts the Django development server, which my can access at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
